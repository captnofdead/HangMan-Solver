# HangMan-Solver

This repository contains an implementation of a hangman solver that uses two algorithms to improve its performance. 

The first algorithm is the N-gram model, where we try to guess letters in the guessing string by looking at the letters which have already been guessed. <br />  <br /> 
The second algorithm is dynamic programming, where we break the string into smaller substrings, and for each substring, we try to get the most frequent letter from the training dictionary. <br />   <br /> 
This hangman solver uses these algorithms to efficiently and accurately solve hangman puzzles.
